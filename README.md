This python script is based on Legume (https://github.com/fancompute/legume and https://legume.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) which is the work of Momchil Minkov and colleagues from Shanhui Fan's group of Stanford.

We (Fiore group from Eindhoven Univeristy of Technology) have used their script to optimize a Photonic Crystal Cavity (PhCC) which is on top of a fiber-tip to be used as a single ultrafine particle (UFP) sensor.

The script is slightly altered from the original. The main differences are: the objective function where we couple the PhCC with the small NA (=0.14) of a single mode fiber (SMF), and our specific design parameters.
